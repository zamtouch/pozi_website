# Cursor Rules for POZI Project

## Build and Deployment Rules

### Pre-Push Build Verification
**CRITICAL**: Before pushing any changes to git, ALWAYS verify that the project is build-ready and will not result in Vercel deployment errors:

1. **Run Build Check**: Execute `npm run build` in the `web` directory to ensure:
   - TypeScript compilation succeeds without errors
   - All imports and dependencies are resolved
   - No syntax errors or type errors exist
   - Next.js static page generation completes successfully
   - No missing environment variables that would cause build failures

2. **Verify Build Output**: Check that the build completes with exit code 0 and shows:
   - ✓ Compiled successfully
   - ✓ Running TypeScript (with no errors)
   - ✓ Collecting page data (completes without errors)
   - ✓ Generating static pages (completes successfully)

3. **Fix All Errors**: If any build errors are found:
   - Fix TypeScript errors immediately
   - Resolve missing imports or dependencies
   - Fix syntax errors
   - Address any type mismatches
   - Ensure all required environment variables are documented

4. **Never Push Broken Builds**: Do NOT commit or push changes if:
   - Build fails with errors
   - TypeScript compilation fails
   - There are unresolved imports
   - Static page generation fails
   - Any linter errors that would block deployment

5. **Build Command**: The build verification command is:
   ```bash
   cd web && npm run build
   ```

### General Development Rules

- Always check for linting errors using `read_lints` before committing
- Ensure all TypeScript types are properly defined
- Verify that all API routes handle errors gracefully
- Test that all pages can be statically generated or rendered correctly
- Ensure environment variables are properly configured for production builds

### Error Prevention

- When fixing build errors, address the root cause, not just symptoms
- If a build error appears, check the entire error stack trace
- Verify that all file paths are correct and files exist
- Ensure all imports use correct paths (relative vs absolute)
- Check that all components are properly exported and imported

## Brand Colors

### Pozi Brand Color Palette

**CRITICAL**: Always use the exact brand color codes when implementing colors throughout the website:

1. **Pozi Brand Yellow/Pink**: `#d6e25c`
   - This is the primary brand color used for:
     - All yellow elements (buttons, highlights, accents)
     - All pink elements (replaced with this color)
     - Search buttons
     - Tab active states
     - Form input focus/hover states
     - Header and footer borders
     - Brand accents and decorative elements

2. **Pozi Green**: `#005b42`
   - Primary brand color for:
     - Main brand elements
     - Headings and primary text
     - Navigation elements

3. **Pozi Yellow-Green**: `#f0f9d8`
   - Light accent color for backgrounds

### Color Usage Rules

- **Never use generic Tailwind yellow or pink classes** (e.g., `yellow-500`, `pink-500`) - always use the brand color `#d6e25c`
- When using the brand yellow/pink color:
  - Use inline styles: `style={{ color: '#d6e25c' }}` or `style={{ backgroundColor: '#d6e25c' }}`
  - For opacity/transparency: `rgba(214, 226, 92, 0.15)` for 15% opacity
  - For hover states: Use a slightly darker shade like `#c4d04a`
- Update CSS variables in `globals.css` and Tailwind config when brand colors change
- Ensure all instances of pink and yellow colors are replaced with `#d6e25c`
- Check for color usage in:
  - Component files
  - CSS files
  - Tailwind config
  - Inline styles
  - CSS variables
