# Cursor Rules for POZI Project

## Build and Deployment Rules

### Pre-Push Build Verification
**CRITICAL**: Before pushing any changes to git, ALWAYS verify that the project is build-ready and will not result in Vercel deployment errors:

1. **Run Build Check**: Execute `npm run build` in the `web` directory to ensure:
   - TypeScript compilation succeeds without errors
   - All imports and dependencies are resolved
   - No syntax errors or type errors exist
   - Next.js static page generation completes successfully
   - No missing environment variables that would cause build failures

2. **Verify Build Output**: Check that the build completes with exit code 0 and shows:
   - ✓ Compiled successfully
   - ✓ Running TypeScript (with no errors)
   - ✓ Collecting page data (completes without errors)
   - ✓ Generating static pages (completes successfully)

3. **Fix All Errors**: If any build errors are found:
   - Fix TypeScript errors immediately
   - Resolve missing imports or dependencies
   - Fix syntax errors
   - Address any type mismatches
   - Ensure all required environment variables are documented

4. **Never Push Broken Builds**: Do NOT commit or push changes if:
   - Build fails with errors
   - TypeScript compilation fails
   - There are unresolved imports
   - Static page generation fails
   - Any linter errors that would block deployment

5. **Build Command**: The build verification command is:
   ```bash
   cd web && npm run build
   ```

### General Development Rules

- Always check for linting errors using `read_lints` before committing
- Ensure all TypeScript types are properly defined
- Verify that all API routes handle errors gracefully
- Test that all pages can be statically generated or rendered correctly
- Ensure environment variables are properly configured for production builds

### Error Prevention

- When fixing build errors, address the root cause, not just symptoms
- If a build error appears, check the entire error stack trace
- Verify that all file paths are correct and files exist
- Ensure all imports use correct paths (relative vs absolute)
- Check that all components are properly exported and imported
